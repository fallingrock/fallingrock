I created, and continue to run, an online community for IBM i professionals called midrange.com.  It hosts technical discussion mailing lists, list archives, and an IBM i dedicated wiki.

From 2010-2016 I was an IBM Power System Champion for my work supporting the IBM i professional community.

I was awarded the COMMON Distinguished Service Award in 2008.

I am an avid cyclist, sometime shutterbug, and an passionate advocate for the diabetic community.
